# Final-project
Final project



This game can only be opened with Unity 5

language used:
- c#


Unity 5 level design project


Things included :
- Third Person view character
- water
- trees
- billboards
- skybox
- crossplatform unit
- Storyline.
- executable file (build/run game)



Download zip, extract the folder, open it up with unity 5

You can run the game by clicking the executable file (game) inside the folder, however, there will be some shader error due to github free user limitation doesn't allow me to put the whole complete shader files.

despite the shader files limitation, it is still good to know that everything works properly and the game can run smooth.


                              Enjoy !!
